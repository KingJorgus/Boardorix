    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Magic: The Gathering is the first and most iconic collectible card game, where players take on the role of planeswalkers—powerful wizards who duel for victory. Each player brings a custom-built deck of cards, representing their spells, creatures, artifacts, and lands. Lands generate mana, the magical resource needed to cast spells, while other cards either remain on the battlefield to influence the game or deliver one-time effects. With over 25,000 unique cards to choose from, deck construction is a core element of the game, allowing players to craft strategies that fit their playstyle.

      In play, opponents draw cards each turn, summoning creatures, casting spells, and carefully managing resources to reduce their rival’s life total to zero or meet another win condition. The game balances chance with strategy—while draws are random, decision-making and timing are critical. Complex mechanics like “the stack,” which governs how spells and abilities interact, create layers of tactics and counterplay. Traditionally played one-on-one, Magic also supports a wide variety of casual and competitive formats, from multiplayer free-for-alls to high-level tournaments, offering endless depth and replayability.
