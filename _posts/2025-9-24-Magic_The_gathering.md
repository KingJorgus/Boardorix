    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan) is a strategy board game where players compete to dominate the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. The board is made of randomly arranged hex tiles representing different terrains that produce resources (brick, wood, ore, wheat, and sheep), with number tokens indicating which dice rolls yield production. Each player starts with two settlements and roads placed on tile intersections, collecting resources based on adjacent terrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a turn, players roll dice to generate resources, trade with others or at ports, and spend resources to expand their network, buy development cards, or upgrade settlements into cities. A roll of 7 activates the robber, blocking resource production on a tile and allowing the active player to steal from an adjacent opponent. Victory points are earned through settlements, cities, the longest road, the largest army, and certain development cards. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.
