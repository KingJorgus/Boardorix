    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Forbidden Island is a cooperative board game where players work together as adventurers to recover four treasures before the island sinks. Instead of competing, everyone must coordinate their moves, manage resources, and make tough sacrifices as rising water levels gradually flood tiles and increase the difficulty. Each game begins with a modular, beautifully illustrated island layout, and players take turns moving pawns, shoring up flooded locations, and collecting the treasures needed to escape. The combination of escalating tension and teamwork makes every playthrough a strategic and exciting challenge.

      What sets Forbidden Island apart is its outstanding production quality paired with affordability. The game comes in a sturdy tin with well-crafted treasures, durable cards, and richly designed tiles that bring the sinking island to life. With multiple difficulty settings, diverse character roles with unique abilities, and different island setups, it offers strong replay value for two to five players. Priced under twenty dollars, it provides both accessibility and depth, making it a rare gem in modern board gaming. Fans of this title may also enjoy its spiritual successor, Forbidden Desert, released by Gamewright in 2013.
